## Personal Backgroung

Hello !!

My name is Lili El Khalil,
I am in my first year of master student at University of Montreal studying psychology.
I am a research assistant with Marie Audrey Lavoie in the visual neurocognition laboratory.

<b> Why BrainHack School? </B>

When joining the BrainHack School, i was looking farward in particular to know more about data analyses and BIDS validation
Which means to be able to analyse my research data results later on and to know how to validate it with BIDS.

In my research Laboratory i was only working with Matlab and my university courses was only about HTML.
But in BrainHack School i had the opportunity to discover more than one application and method.

You can join me on GitHub at [lilielkhalil](https://github.com/lilielkhalil) or by mail at <lilykhalil98@gmail.com>

Project Definition

## Project background

The Projet Courtois NeuroMod is a longitudinal fMRI data acquisition project where participants get scanned almost every week.
One risk associated with intensives protocols like this one is the chronic exposure of the participants to high noise levels during the scan sessions.
This is why it is important to regularly monitor their auditory health to ensure that the research protocol is not causing any damage to the participants' hearing.
Part of the auditory perception's job is to do this monitoring task.
To do so, the participants go through different clinical tests every month to keep track of the evolution of their auditory health.
Since the dataset is not currently BIDS compatible, it could be interesting to create a jupyter notebook to automatically create a BIDS format database from the data. 

## Tools

We Expected to use the following tools, technologies and libraries for this project :

- Git 
- GitHub
- Jupyter Notebook
- The Bash terminal
- Markdown
- BIDS
- Machine learning

## Data

## Deliverables

By the end of The BrainHack School, we aimed to have the following:

- README.md file
- Jupyter notebooks with code and explanations
- GitHub repository documenting the project
- Presentation showing project results
